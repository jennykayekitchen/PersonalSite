      <p>Full Stack Software Developer based in Nashville, Tennessee</p>
      <p>In 2003, I received my senior class' "I'll Take Care of It" award, and I've been chasing that high ever since. The award showcases my lifelong desire to help others, be a team player, and solve problems. 
        This, along with my passion for creativity and design, allows me to create functional and captivating websites/software that provide innovative solutions to stakeholder needs.

    <div class="about-me-text">
      <p>I am a software developer with a passion for design and a knack for problem-solving. During my time at Nashville Software School (an
        intensive full-time software development bootcamp), I learned skills in HTML,
        CSS, JavaScript, and React, C#/.NET, and SQL, and have experience working with GitHub, VS Code, and Visual Studio.</p>
      <p>Prior to my foray into software development, I worked in the corporate world, gaining experience in program
        coordination, case management, and human resources at companies such as Amazon.com and CKE Restaurants Holdings,
        Inc. I have a track record of providing excellent customer service and building strong relationships with
        both internal and external stakeholders. I am confident that my diverse skillset and experience will allow me to create software that meets the needs of clients and users alike.</p>

          <h4><b>My Version</b></h4>
          <p>My Version is my front-end capstone project that acts as a playlist generator for Taylor Swift songs. Users
            can create multiple “moods” and assign one or more moods to each of her songs, and then generate a list of
            songs based on up to two moods that are selected.</p>

          <h4><b>The ClassApp</b></h4>
          <p>I created the ClassApp with a classmate to help our cohort stay connected and organized. Whether we're
            getting together to work on a group project, looking for job leads, or we just want to hang out, the
            ClassApp has us covered. We can create, edit, and delete events with ease.</p>

          <h4><b>The Junior Tri-Wizard Tournament</b></h4>
          <p>The Junior Tri-Wizard Tournament is a Harry Potter themed app created to allow the students who can’t compete in the Goblet of Fire to still participate in the challenge. 
            Students will be tested on their knowledge of spells, potions, and famous witches and wizards. 
            As each student wins a game, they will earn points for their school. 
            Let the games begin, and may the best school win!</p>
